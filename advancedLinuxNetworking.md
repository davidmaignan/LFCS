```blockquotes
[ The TCP/IP set by Comer + TCP/IP Illustrated set by Richard Stevens + The TCP/IP Guide by Charles M. Kozierok ] and are the only books about TCP/IP stack that are worth reading.

Comer is a bit dryer than Stevens
Stevens has excellent examples
Kozierok has more details and drawing / pictures

All the above books will provide everything you need to know

Code impementation is provided by Comer and Stevens

Next step would be books like "Unix Network Programming" by Stevens, "Understanding Linux Network Internals" by Benvenuti,
"The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming..." by Kerrisk, etc etc etc
